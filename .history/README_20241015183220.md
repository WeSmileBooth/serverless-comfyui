# Serverless-comfy

## Requirements

To use this project, ensure you have the following:

- A modal.com account
- Modal.com CLI installed
- Python 3.8 installed on your machine

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository**:
   If you have not cloned the repository yet, do so by running:

```bash
git clone [repository-url]
cd serverless-comfy
```

2. **Deploy the API**:
   To deploy the application using Modal, run the following command:

```bash
modal run comfy-api
```

For more detailed information on deployment and the Modal platform, refer to the Modal.com documentation.

## Customizing the Workflow

### Adding New Models

To add a new model, follow these steps:

1. **Locate the MODELS array**:
   Open the `comfy-api/models.py` file and look for the `MODELS` array at the top. This array defines the models to be used in the workflow. Example:

```python
MODELS = [
    {
        "url": "https://huggingface.co/Yabo/SDXL_LoRA/resolve/main/dreamshaperXL_alpha2Xl10.safetensors",
        "directory": "/root/models/checkpoints",
    },
    {
        "url": "https://huggingface.co/datasets/Gourieff/ReActor/resolve/main/models/inswapper_128.onnx",
        "directory": "/root/models/insightface",
    }
]
```

2. **Add a new model**:

- Ensure that the model URL is a valid HuggingFace link.
- Specify the directory where the model should be stored (starting with `/root/models`).

3. **Deploy the updated configuration**:
   After updating the models, redeploy the project:

```bash
modal run comfy-api
```

### Adding New Nodes

To add a new node to the workflow, follow similar steps as with models:

1. **Locate the NODES array**
   Open the `comfy-api/nodes.py` file and look for the `NODES` array. Example:

```python
NODES = [
    "https://github.com/Gourieff/comfyui-reactor-node",
    "https://github.com/ltdrdata/ComfyUI-Manager",
]
```

2. **Add a new node**
   Add the GitHub URL of the node you want to include.

3. **Deploy the updated configuration**
   Run the following command to rebuild the container and update the nodes:

```bash
modal run comfy-api
```

### Modifying the Workflow

#### Updating the Workflow Configuration

You can modify the workflow by either tweaking existing values or replacing the workflow file.

1.  **Modify values**
    If you need to update values like model names or parameters, modify the workflow_api.json file located in `comfy-api/workflow_api.json`.

        For example, to change the checkpoint used:

```json
{
	"5": {
		"inputs": {
			"ckpt_name": "dreamshaperXL_alpha2Xl10.safetensors"
		},
		"class_type": "CheckpointLoaderSimple",
		"_meta": {
			"title": "Load Checkpoint"
		}
	}
}
```

2. **Replace the workflow file**
   If you have a new workflow, export it from ComfyUI with developer mode enabled. Save the exported file as `workflow_api.json` and replace the existing one under `comfy-api/workflow_api.json`.

Make sure the structure of the new workflow file aligns with the expected format.
Example structure:

```json
{
	"1": {
		"inputs": {
			"image": "test.png",
			"upload": "image"
		},
		"class_type": "LoadImage",
		"_meta": {
			"title": "Load Image"
		}
	},
	"11": {
		"inputs": {
			"seed": 671311003833018,
			"steps": 25,
			"cfg": 6,
			"sampler_name": "dpmpp_2m",
			"model": ["65", 0]
		},
		"class_type": "KSampler",
		"_meta": {
			"title": "KSampler"
		}
	}
}
```

Adjust input keys: The workflow file references keys like `11` for seeds, `1` for images, and `9` for text. These might differ in your new workflow, so update them in the `comfy-api/__init__.py` file.

Example:

```python
workflow["11"]["inputs"]["seed"] = random.randint(1, 2**64)
workflow["1"]["inputs"]["image"] = input.session_id
workflow["9"]["inputs"]["text"] += input.prompt
```

Ensure that the new key mappings align with your updated workflow structure.

### Removing Models or Nodes

If you wish to remove a model or node:
After removing the entries, redeploy the project.

### Removing Models

Simply remove the corresponding entry from the `MODELS` array in `comfy-api/models.py`.

### Removing Nodes

Remove the desired node from the `NODES` array in `comfy-api/nodes.py`.
